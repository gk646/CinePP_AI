## CinePP_AI

#### A small movie reccomendation AI project using the https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 100k database  



#### Goals:
Making a entry level implementation of some machine learning algorithms and principles in C++

- [X] I/O of database files (both raw and in object arrays)
- [X] use normal math to parse the database and find reccommendations (Jaccard Index, Rating sorting)
- [X] basic framework for a neural network
- [ ] implement learning methods for the network (back propagation)
- [ ] use the model to give movie reccommendations
- [ ] make a filetype to save and import models
